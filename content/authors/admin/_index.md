I am a second-year Ph.D. student in the Computer Science Department at Northwestern University. I received my undergraduate degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University (ACM Honors Class) in 2018. Previously, I was a research intern at MSRA, under the supervision of Jifeng Dai. I also worked as a research assistant at Shanghai Jiao Tong University BCMI Lab, directed by Professor Liqing Zhang. My research interests focus on the intersection of machine learning and cyber-physical system.

My research direction mainly focus on AI in cyber-physical system. While AI is more and more frequently included as a component of a large complex system with varies of factors included (non-AI component, human in loop, etc.), many challenges exposed in actual development and integration. Instead of simply considering AI as a stand-alone software application, we should take more issues into account -- data availability and quality, resource/timing constrain, disturbance and attacks, generalization and adaptation, etc.

And my research field also related to deep learning, HVAC system, computer vision, and cyber-physical security.
